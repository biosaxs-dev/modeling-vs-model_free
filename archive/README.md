# Archive

This folder contains documents from the original research project exploring the broader question of "modeling vs model-free" approaches in SEC-SAXS analysis.

## Archived Documents

### discussion_points.md
Original planning document for a comprehensive research paper comparing explicit modeling (Molass) versus implicit "model-free" approaches (REGALS, EFAMIX). Contains detailed thesis development, comparison frameworks, and mathematical critique.

**Status**: Archived (scope broader than JOSS validation needs)

### detailed_approach.md
18-week implementation plan with two research tracks:
- Track 1: Mathematical derivation of implicit functional forms
- Track 2: Numerical verification via simulations

**Status**: Archived (extensive research agenda beyond validation scope)

## Relationship to Current Project

The current repository is now focused on **validating specific claims** made in the Molass Library JOSS paper's Research Impact Statement. These archived documents represent a more ambitious research project that may be pursued separately in the future.

The mathematical explorations in `explorations/` remain as supporting analysis, while the `evidence/` directory now contains targeted validation of the specific documented limitations cited in the JOSS submission.

## Future Use

These documents may be valuable if pursuing:
1. A full research paper on implicit vs explicit modeling
2. Extended mathematical analysis of regularization methods
3. Comprehensive comparative studies of SEC-SAXS decomposition methods

For now, they serve as background context and potential future work.
