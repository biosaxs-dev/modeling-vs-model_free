# Modeling vs Model-Free SEC-SAXS Analysis

This repository documents the comparative analysis of SEC-SAXS decomposition approaches, providing evidence for the **Research Impact Statement** in the Molass Library JOSS paper submission ([#9424](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/9424)).

## Purpose

To systematically validate claims about documented limitations of existing "model-free" methods (CHROMIXS, EFAMIX, REGALS) and demonstrate how Molass Library's explicit parametric modeling approach addresses these limitations for overlapping chromatographic peak decomposition.

## Key Questions

1. **CHROMIXS**: Does it defer overlapping peak analysis to other methods as stated?
2. **EFAMIX**: What are the quantified failure thresholds (SNR, peak asymmetry, separation)?
3. **REGALS**: What fundamental limitations does it inherit from EFA (Evolving Factor Analysis)?
4. **Molass Library**: How does explicit parametric modeling widen the scope of tractable cases?

## Status

**In preparation** - Setting up comparative framework and literature review.

See [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for detailed progress tracking.
