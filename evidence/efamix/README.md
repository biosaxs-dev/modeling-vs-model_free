# EFAMIX Evidence

## Claims to Validate

**From JOSS paper Research Impact Statement:**
> "EFAMIX quantifies failure thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio ≥10³ required for three-component separation; peak asymmetry parameter τ≤2; baseline width separation ≥2× for reliable decomposition)"

## Specific Thresholds to Extract

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- [ ] Two components: SNR ≥ ?
- [ ] Three components: SNR ≥ 10³ photons
- [ ] Four components: SNR ≥ ?

### Peak Asymmetry (τ parameter)
- [ ] Maximum tolerable: τ ≤ 2
- [ ] Context: symmetric vs asymmetric peaks

### Peak Separation
- [ ] Minimum separation: ≥ 2× peak width
- [ ] Context: baseline separation requirement

### Other Limitations
- [ ] Concentration ratio constraints
- [ ] Overlapping peak tolerance
